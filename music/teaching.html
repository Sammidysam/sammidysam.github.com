  <span class="content-emph">Contact Me</span>
  I am interested in teaching if it interests you!
  The easiest way to get in touch is to email me at
  <a href="mailto:craigsamm@gmail.com">craigsamm@gmail.com</a>.

  <span class="content-emph">Rates, etc.</span>
  While I am still in college and in the midwest, I plan to charge
  <span class="content-emph">$25 per lesson</span>.
  This rate comes from my first teacher in Indiana charging $30 per lesson,
  and me not yet having my college degree but still putting a huge amount
  of time into music.
  However, I have not set my own rate for a while because I have
  been teaching through organizations.
  In any case, please do be in touch if this rate sounds like too steep of
  a hill to climb.
  I would never like financial constraints to limit musical growth.

  <span class="content-emph">Philosophy</span>
  My biggest goal when teaching is for the material to be fun.
  If you love a song or a music group, let's explore that music and learn
  how it works and how we can play it!
  I happened to fall in love with classical music in the end, but
  it is not a requirement for you to.
  I am happy for us to chase your passion, together.

  <span class="content-emph">Past Experience</span>
  I have been thrilled to get the opportunity to teach both in high school
  and in Oberlin.
  In high school, I started teaching bass during my junior year, and proceeded
  to have four students total over the next two years.
  At Oberlin, I have volunteered with the public school orchestra a fair amount.
  During my first year, I helped out Oberlin's high school orchestra bassists, then
  their middle school orchestra bassists during my second year.
  During my third year, I started teaching some bass students in the
  <a href="https://www.noyo.org/">Northern Ohio Youth Orchestra</a> privately.
  I also taught private lessons to some students in the Oberlin public school
  system through Oberlin Conservatory's String Pedagogy II class.
